# react-webpack-boilerplate

> A SPA boilerplate with React, built with love.

I think a fantastic boilerplate is good for us to learn a library such like **Vue** and **React**. Since Vue has [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack), and in my personal opinion, the so-called full-featured boilerplates with React are mostly suck. So I decided to build one, referenced by vue-cli. Hope it can help you learn React with no extra burden. If you are familiar with vue-cli, this boilerplate may be the best for you.

## What's included
 - **React** 15.3.1
 - **JSX**
 - **ES6**
 - **Webpack**
 - **Express** the dev-server.
 - **Hot-Reload**
 - **Proxy** I think most of the boilerplates drop this important feature.
 - **Global-Variable**

## Usage

In the very beginning you need to `clone` this project in your local environment.
```bash
# install all this dependencies.
npm install

# development, default port: 3000
npm run dev

# production
npm run build
```
